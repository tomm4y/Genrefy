# Genrefy by Thomas Le and Aldiyar Seidaliyev
The main target audience for this app is people who love music and want to experience more outside of their comfort zone. A lot of people end up listening to the same type of music over and over again because that's what theyâ€™re used to and they don't feel like stepping out of their comfort zone. This app will encourage users to experiment with different genres of music and understand the background of the genre as well as the stylings of the songs. The purpose of this is to allow people to experience something new in terms of music and come to find appreciation to other genres.
