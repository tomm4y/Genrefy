# Purpose and Audience
The main target audience for this app is people who love music and want to experience more outside of their comfort zone. A lot of people end up listening to the same type of music over and over again because that's what theyâ€™re used to and they don't feel like stepping out of their comfort zone. This app will encourage users to experiment with different genres of music and understand the background of the genre as well as the stylings of the songs. The purpose of this is to allow people to experience something new in terms of music and come to find appreciation to other genres.

# Functionality
It will allow the user to scroll through an initial screen of many different genres of music to select from. After clicking on one, the user is taken to a different screen in which a description of the chosen genre will be provided as well as 2 similar subgenres and a scrollable list of songs of the initially selected genre. If the user clicks on one of the names of similar subgenres, they are then taken to the main screen of that respective genre. Within this screen if a user clicks on the green play button, the song selected will play on a separate screen in which the user is able to see the song name, artist name, song cover, song length, and how far the user is into the song. The user is able to interact with the last page by clicking the buttons on the bottom which allow the user to pause and play the song, skip to the next or previous song, and skip ten seconds forwards or backwards within the song.
